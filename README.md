# Score app - my first VUE app

This is my first ever Vue.js application, created to practice and solidify my knowledge of the framework. The inspiration came from playing card games with my son, where manually keeping score on an Excel spreadsheet proved cumbersome on our phones. To address this inconvenience, I built this app as a more efficient and interactive way to track scores. Feel free to try it out at [score.MichalKotek.tech](score.michalkotek.tech) or contribute by forking the code here on [GitHub](https://github.com/ElectricKota/vue-score).
